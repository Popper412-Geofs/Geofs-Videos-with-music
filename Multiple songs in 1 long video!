Please grab some popcorn ya'll and enjoy this 1hr and 30min special.

NOTE: If you're a guitar player. be prepared to grab ur axe and shred.


DISCLAIMER!: It didn't occur to me (at all) that this is only 40 mins... Yeah. i ran out of space for full 1hr and 30 mins... I'm so sorry. Sooo
At least enjoy the one song and the many landings... i'll TRY to get the rest of recording back up.
